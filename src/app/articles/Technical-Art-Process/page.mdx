The process begins with conceptualization, highlighting artistic decisions such as shifting the scene’s time of day to
sunrise, symbolizing a new beginning. Drawing inspiration from the Ionian Islands, research and reference gathering
informed the landscape’s aesthetics. The terrain was carefully curated in Gaea, then textured using a
combination of displacement mapping and high-resolution assets in Blender.
## Key technical implementations include:
* **Sky and Atmosphere:** HDRI lighting and shader blending techniques to create a realistic dawn setting
* **Terrain Creation:** Procedural terrain generation, texture blending, and optimized masking for natural variation
* **Water Simulation:** A complex shader network to achieve realistic reflections, depth, and wave movement
* **Environmental Detailing:** Scatter systems for trees, grass, and rocks using Blender’s Geoscatter and Botaniq plugins
* **Architectural Elements:** Kitbashing castle assets from real-world scans to create an authentic Ithacan townscape
* **Historical Accuracy:** Integration of a detailed Trireme Galley ship model to reinforce the era’s maritime culture
* **Lighting and Post-Processing:** Strategic light placement for depth and contrast, followed by compositing adjustments to enhance realism
